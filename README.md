# PHP Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP programming involving loose comparison (`==`) between strings and integers.  The issue stems from PHP's type juggling behavior, where it attempts to convert operands to a common type before comparison.  This can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug errors.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using strict comparison (`===`).
