This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling. The comparison `$a == $b` uses loose comparison, meaning PHP will attempt to convert the operands to a common type before comparing.  This can lead to unexpected results when dealing with strings and numbers.

```php
<?php
$a = "10";
$b = 10;
if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal";
} else {
  echo "Not Equal";
}
?>
```

In this example, even though `$a` is a string and `$b` is an integer, the loose comparison `==` considers them equal because PHP converts the string "10" to an integer 10 before comparison. This behavior is often unexpected and can introduce hard-to-find bugs.
